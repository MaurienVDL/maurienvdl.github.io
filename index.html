                        into meaningful insights, currently working at a R&D-company
                        while pursuing my Master’s in Astronomy and Data Science. 
                        Beyond my technical work, I enjoy contributing to the 
                        academic community as an elected member of the Faculty Council 
                        and participating in politics as a policy assistant for a local
                        municipal political party.

                <h4>Astronomy Bachelor Project: Searching for hypervelocity star candidates in Gaia DR3</h4>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p> This research searched for hypervelocity stars (HVSs) in Gaia data release 3. A hypervelocity star is a star moving at such a high speed that the star is 
                        unbound from its galaxy of origin. These stars are thought to have been kicked out of their orbits by gravitational interactions with other objects, such
                        as other stars or black holes. Finding HVSs may therefore give insight into the properties of massive black holes.
                    </p>   
                    <p> We focused on HVSs that originated in the galactic centre of our Milky Way and have been ejected according to the Hills mechanism. 
                        We searched for HVS in a region where we expect the highest density of them. This region we defined ourselves based on the results of the spatial 
                        distribution for HVS simulations from Generozov et al. (2022) and the found clumped HVS candidates from Brown et al. (2014). We found a way of searching within 
                        that region for HVSs, not knowing the radial velocities and distances of the stars. A number of 12,377,535 HVS candidates have been found in total. Whereof 11 
                        HVS candidates would have been ejected from the GC around the same time as the clumped stars from Brown et al. (2014).

                <h4>Astronomy First Master Project: Real time classification with DISTURB</h4>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p> Solar Radio Bursts are the associated radio emissions of solar flares, often characterized by a high intensity and observed as complex patterns in dynamic 
                        spectral images. Based on those patterns, five spectral types can be distinguished; spectral types I to V. 
                        Each spectral type has its own emission mechanism which relates them to space weather on Earth, making the task of real-time detection and classification valuable.
                        Type-II's are in particular interesting due to their greatly varying time structures and relatively rare occurrence, making this type a challenge to accurately classify. 
                    </p>  
                    <p> With data from DISTURB, located at the site of the WRST, Dwingeloo, The Netherlands, 73 type-II's were identified from October 2023 to March 2023. 
                        Along the type-II's 685 individual type-III's, 337 type-III clusters and 29 type-V's were identified and used to train a YOLO model.
                    </p>
                    <p> The YOLO series popped up in papers as "state of the art" algorithm. Its latest version (from late 2023), version 8, didn't disappoint. 
                        Compared were the YOLO-v8 Nano, Small, Medium, and Large model versions. Found was the Nano version to be the best for type-II's and good for type-III's 
                        and type-V's.
                    </p>
                    <p> Trained is a final YOLO-v8 Nano model that accurately classifies type-II's, individual type-III's and type-III clusters with MAP-scores at the IoU threshold of 0.5 
                        of 0.890, 0.890 and 0.837 respectively and type-V's of 0.304. The optimal precision scores of the classes are 0.94, 0.90, 0.88 and 0.25 for the classes. 
                        With the final model, type-II's can be detected with high accuracy within minutes after the start of the burst. Making real life detection and classification 
                        possible.

                <h4>Astronomy Second Master Project: PRISMA hyperspectral data for terrain assessments</h4>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p> Terrain assessment is gaining importance in military applications, with soil classification serving as a critical foundation. 
                        PRISMA hyperspectral L2D images, combined with soil information from the SSURGO database, were used to train various machine learning algorithms to 
                        differentiate between soil types. The results indicate the effectiveness of hyperspectral data from the PRISMA satellite for training models to 
                        classify soil types. However, achieving generalizability remains challenging due to the fine variations among different labels and widely variable 
                        hyperspectral signatures across the images. 
                    </p>   
                    <p> The model architecture best suited for the complex task of training on hyperspectral images is found to be a 1D-CNN, as it effectively identifies 
                        underlying structures in the data. In contrast, tree-based models, although able to train on the data effectively, did not appear to capture any 
                        meaningful structure. A different model, the D2-BERT model, was also tested. While it performed approximately the same as the 1D-CNN, its architecture 
                        was found to be unnecessary complex for the task. Additionally, several improvement suggestions are proposed to enhance model generalizability.
